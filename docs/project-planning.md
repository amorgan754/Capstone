### Research
 Looking into family hub, household hub, and family tracker I only found information on the Samsung Family Hub fridge, smart home devices, and actual trackers like Life360
 Some users like the idea of multiple views of things like the calendar
 Users think that being able to color code would be helpful
 - Some APIs to be used
  - Weather
  - Calendar to synch to google calendar
